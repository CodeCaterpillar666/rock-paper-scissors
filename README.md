# rock-paper-scissors
This is a toy project to practice basic JacaScript.

It is a five-round rock-paper-scissors game. In each round, you enter your selection and the console will show current round's result. At the end, you will also get a final result of the total 5-round game.

How to play the game:
1. Open the index.html in chrome either by [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) or any other way.
2. Open the console, type `game()` and press `Enter`, there will be a propt window pop out and ask you to input `"Rock"`, `"Paper"` or `"Scissors"`(case insensitive), choose one input and enter.
